# password-generator
Program that generates a password

It has these parameters:
Length
Minimum Digits Count
Maximum Digits Count
Minimum Underlines Count
Maximum Underlines Count
Minimum Caps Letters Count
Maximum Caps Letters Count

Standart symbol: lower letter

The algorithm consists in the fact that the program generates a password from small letters and special characters.
Special characters are almost always not enough. Under this condition, redundant small letters are replaced with special characters. All numbers (minima and maxima) of special characters do not exceed the password length
